    "#### Curse of Dimentionality\n",
    "    1. When number of features (dimensions) increases, data becomes sparse (spread out).\n",
    "    2. Machine learning models need more data to understand high-dimensional space.\n",
    "    3. Distance-based algorithms (KNN, K-Means) become unreliable in high dimensions.\n",
    "    4. The model becomes slower and overfits easily.\n",
    "    5. Noise increases, useful information decreases.\n",
    "    6. Visualization becomes difficult because you can’t “see” data beyond 3D.\n",
    "    7. Models perform worse unless we do feature selection or dimensionality reduction (PCA).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is “dimension”?\n",
    "    Dimension = number of features (columns) in your dataset.\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "        Age (1D)\n",
